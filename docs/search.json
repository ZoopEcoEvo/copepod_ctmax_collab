A total of 88 CTmax measurements were made.\nIn general, cyclopoids had higher CTmax values than calanoid copepods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTmax data is shown below for individuals were a genus was recorded (or could be speculated). Note, these CTmax values do not account for differences in collection temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroken down by habitat type, there are clear differences between thermal limits in the littoral, surface waters, and metalimnion. Again, these comparisons do not account for differences in collection temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese differences in thermal limits may be attributed to multiple factors, including variation in species composition and acclimation to the different environments. Shown below are CTmax values from the different habitats, grouped by genus, allowing us to infer the relative contribution of these different mechanisms. The increased thermal limits in the littoral community are largely due to changes in community composition (genera/species in the littoral have higher CTmax values than those in the surface waters). For several genera (Eudiaptomus and Eurytemora, for example), the change in CTmax between the surface wates and metalimnion may be driven by acclimation - individuals from the metalimnion were collected from water around 10°C cooler than the surface waters."

Turn on the aquarium pump and the thermometer and place the probe in the water bath. Adjust the temperature of the water to the starting temperature (e.g. the temperature at the time of collection, the acclimation temperature, etc.) using either the heating element (if temperature needs to increase) or with ice (if temperature needs to decrease; Remember to adjust the final volume back to 2 L if ice is added).\nWhile the water bath is adjusting, put 10 mL of medium (filtered lake water, artificial lake/seawater, etc). into each of the 50 mL tubes. Arrange these in the tube racks in the water bath. Tubes should be numbered and should occupy the same position in the tube rack each time.\nWhen the temperature in the bath is correctly set, move the thermometer probe to one of the tubes (assigned at random). Ensure that the probe is fully submerged throughout the duration of the experiment.\nOnce the water in the tube is at the correct temperature, individual copepods are placed into each of the remaining tubes. A light source underneath the water bath can sometimes help to see copepods as they are added. It can be helpful to record information about the individual in the margins of the data sheet as they’re added (are they carrying an egg sac, is there a putative species ID, etc.).\nCopepods should be given a 5 minute resting period. Any individuals not actively moving after this resting period should be replaced or removed from the experiment.\nAfter the resting period, turn on the heating element to initiate the temperature ramp. There may be slight drift in temperature during this resting period: take note of the temperature at the start of the temperature ramp on the data sheet.\nCopepods should be closely monitored throughout the ramp. Individuals will typically sink to the bottom of the tube as they approach CTmax. CTmax is the point where an individual no longer moves in response to stimuli. A gently stimulus (creating some water movement with a transfer pipette or gently turning the tubes) should be used to determine when the individual has reached CTmax.\nAs individuals reach CTmax, record the temperature and remove the tube from the water bath. CTmax is a non-lethal assay; individuals should recover as water temperatures cool. Individuals that have died likely surpassed CTmax and should be excluded from the data.\nOnce all individuals have reached CTmax unplug the heating element and the aquarium pump and turn off the thermometer."

Ensure that the entire prosome is clearly visible. Make sure you have some way of matching the picture to the individual (name the files, record the order in which they were photographed, etc.).\nIn ImageJ, start with the picture of the scale bar. With the straight line segment tool selected, drag a segment along the length of the scale bar. In the ‘Analyze’ menu, select ‘Set Scale’. Leave the ‘Distance in pixels’ as is (this takes the measurement from the length of the segment you drew onto the scale bar). Input the ‘Known distance’ (usually 1 or 2 mm, depending on the scale bar). Leave the ‘Pixel aspect ratio’ as 1. Make sure you check the ‘Global’ box before hitting ‘OK’. From here on, when you make a measurement (command M, on a Mac) from a straight line segment, the value returned will be in mm instead of pixels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example segment used to measure prosome length for a calanoid copepod.\n\n\n\n\nWhen measuring copepod body size, we use the prosome length.

    "text": "Information on methods for collecting samples.\n\nRetrieve the collection kit from the copepod room.\n\nThis kit should contain the field notebook, the large plankton net, a cod end, a thermometer, and the insulated carrier (large black water bottle). Other supplies that may be useful are a couple 4 qt cubes with lids, the hand-held microscope, and a salinometer.\n\nOnce at the collection site, unfold the plankton net and before attaching the cod end, rinse the net by raising and lowering it out of the water several times. Attach the cod end - make sure it is firmly attached. Before starting the tow, fill the cod end by lowering the net into the water and then rapidly raising it. Use this sample to check the temperature and then add the contents of the cod end to the insulated carrier to bring it to the correct temperature. Record information about the date, time, collection site, and environmental conditions in the field notebook.\n\nTry to keep the carrier out of direct sunlight from this point onward.\n\nTo start the tow, reattach the cod end and then fill it as described above. Once the cod end is full (has sunk below the surface), start moving the net horizontally. The goal is to remove any air bubbles from the net so that the entire net is submerged. Move quickly enough to keep the net horizontal, but avoid moving so quickly that the mouth of the net breaks the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the net is full horizontal, with the mouth and the cod end fully submerged\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the conditions at the site (how abundant the animals are) you may need to tow for different amounts of time. A good rule of thumb is to tow the net several lengths of the pier and then pull it up to check the density of animals. Be sure to rinse anything stuck on the sides of the net down into the cod end by raising and lowering it into the water several times. After pulling the net up, drain ~2/3 of the water from the cod end before unscrewing it from the net.\nCheck the contents of the cod end to 1) ensure there are copepods present and 2) to check the approximate density (few, some, many, etc.). Keep in mind the number needed for the experiment - CTmax assays, for example, will only need 10-50 animals. Transfer the contents of the cod end to the insulated carrier. Record your initial observations about the abundance in the field notebook.\nRepeat the tow procedure as needed to obtain enough animals.\nOnce finished, rinse the net (raising and lowering it out of the water several times without the cod end attached).\nReturn to lab. It’s important that you thoroughly rinse off the net in the sink before you return it to storage. Make sure the collection kit is ready for the next person to take it."
