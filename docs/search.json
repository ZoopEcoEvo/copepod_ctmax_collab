If the top is exposed, add tap water.\n\nAdjust to the temperature animals were collected at (using either the heating element or by adding ice).\nAdd 20 mL of bottled spring water to each tube. The water circulating through the bath will bring the tubes to the correct temperature.\nWhen the water bath is at the correct temperature, add one copepod to each tube.\nWait for 10 minutes, then check each individual to ensure they are behaving normally and responding to stimuli.\nTurn on the water heater, restart the temperature logger and start the stopwatch\n\nCHECK POINT: Make sure all three components (heater, temperature logger, stopwatch) are operational before continuing. Failure of any will result in an unusable experimental replicate.\nStart the stopwatch and temperature logger simultaneously.\nMake sure to observe the correct start up messages at ~2 minutes on the temperature logger. If you miss them, simply restart the temperature logger and stopwatch.\n\nMonitor the individuals as temperature ramps.\nUsing the data sheets, record the time when each individual reaches their CTmax.\n\nRemember the three indicators: no response to stimuli for 5-10 seconds, antennules in abnormal position, and a bend in the urosome.\n\nRemove individuals from the water bath after they reach their CTmax. These tubes do not need to be monitored any longer.\nOnce all individuals have been removed, stop the temperature logger and turn off the water bath.\n\nCHECK POINT: Is the heating element unplugged?\n\nAfter the device is shut down, double check all data sheets are correctly filled out. Remove the microSD card from the Arduino logger and transfer the temperature data to the Google Drive. Do not open the file, as this can mess with the format of the date column.\n\nThis is the end of the CTmax assay. If other phenotypic measurements are going to be made, typically you will remove each individual from their tube and place them on the lid from a 96-well plate for easier examination under a microscope. Make sure to keep track of which individual they are (make sure the Tube ID matches the well number)."

Once the scale bar is photographed, do not alter the magnification.\nCarefully remove water from the droplet using a small pipette until a film is formed. Take care not to break the surface tension. The film should be a uniform depth across the entire well. This should hold the copepod fairly still, allowing you to get a clear photograph of the individual (prevents movement blur and prevents magnification by the water droplet).\nPhotograph the individual. Ensure that the entire prosome is clearly visible. Make sure you have some way of matching the picture to the individual (name the files, record the order in which they were photographed, etc.).\nIn ImageJ, start with the picture of the scale bar. With the straight line segment tool selected, drag a segment along the length of the scale bar. In the ‘Analyze’ menu, select ‘Set Scale’. Leave the ‘Distance in pixels’ as is (this takes the measurement from the length of the segment you drew onto the scale bar). Input the ‘Known distance’ (usually 1 or 2 mm, depending on the scale bar). Leave the ‘Pixel aspect ratio’ as 1. Make sure you check the ‘Global’ box before hitting ‘OK’. From here on, when you make a measurement (command M, on a Mac) from a straight line segment, the value returned will be in mm instead of pixels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example segment used to measure prosome length for a calanoid copepod.\n\n\n\n\nWhen measuring copepod body size, we use the prosome length.

    "text": "Retrieve the collection kit from the copepod room.\n\nThis kit should contain the field notebook, the large plankton net, a cod end, a thermometer, and the insulated carrier (large black water bottle). Other supplies that may be useful are a couple 4 qt cubes with lids, the hand-held microscope, and a salinometer.\n\nOnce at the collection site, unfold the plankton net and before attaching the cod end, rinse the net by raising and lowering it out of the water several times. Attach the cod end - make sure it is firmly attached. Before starting the tow, fill the cod end by lowering the net into the water and then rapidly raising it. Use this sample to check the temperature and then add the contents of the cod end to the insulated carrier to bring it to the correct temperature. Record information about the date, time, collection site, and environmental conditions in the field notebook.\n\nTry to keep the carrier out of direct sunlight from this point onward.\n\nTo start the tow, reattach the cod end and then fill it as described above. Once the cod end is full (has sunk below the surface), start moving the net horizontally. The goal is to remove any air bubbles from the net so that the entire net is submerged. Move quickly enough to keep the net horizontal, but avoid moving so quickly that the mouth of the net breaks the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the net is full horizontal, with the mouth and the cod end fully submerged\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the conditions at the site (how abundant the animals are) you may need to tow for different amounts of time. A good rule of thumb is to tow the net several lengths of the pier and then pull it up to check the density of animals. Be sure to rinse anything stuck on the sides of the net down into the cod end by raising and lowering it into the water several times. After pulling the net up, drain ~2/3 of the water from the cod end before unscrewing it from the net.\nCheck the contents of the cod end to 1) ensure there are copepods present and 2) to check the approximate density (few, some, many, etc.). Keep in mind the number needed for the experiment - CTmax assays, for example, will only need 10-50 animals. Transfer the contents of the cod end to the insulated carrier. Record your initial observations about the abundance in the field notebook.\nRepeat the tow procedure as needed to obtain enough animals.\nOnce finished, rinse the net (raising and lowering it out of the water several times without the cod end attached).\nReturn to lab. It’s important that you thoroughly rinse off the net in the sink before you return it to storage. Make sure the collection kit is ready for the next person to take it."
