title: "Copepod Thermal Ecology Collaboration"
---

This site is the central hub for our ongoing collaboration on the thermal ecology of freshwater copepods. It serves two purposes, to help organize within the group of collaborators and to showcase our work to external parties.

The code underlying this site as well as the data and code associated with the scientific aspects of this project are housed in this GitHub repository.
