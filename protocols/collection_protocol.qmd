Information on methods for collecting samples.

1.  Retrieve the collection kit from the copepod room.

    -   This kit should contain the **field notebook**, the **large plankton net**, a **cod end**, a **thermometer**, and the **insulated carrier** (large black water bottle). Other supplies that may be useful are a couple 4 qt cubes with lids, the hand-held microscope, and a salinometer.

2.  Once at the collection site, unfold the plankton net and before attaching the cod end, rinse the net by raising and lowering it out of the water several times. Attach the cod end - make sure it is firmly attached. Before starting the tow, fill the cod end by lowering the net into the water and then rapidly raising it. Use this sample to check the temperature and then add the contents of the cod end to the insulated carrier to bring it to the correct temperature. Record information about the date, time, collection site, and environmental conditions in the field notebook.

    -   Try to keep the carrier out of direct sunlight from this point onward.

3.  To start the tow, reattach the cod end and then fill it as described above. Once the cod end is full (has sunk below the surface), start moving the net horizontally. The goal is to remove any air bubbles from the net so that the entire net is submerged. Move quickly enough to keep the net horizontal, but avoid moving so quickly that the mouth of the net breaks the surface.

4.  Depending on the conditions at the site (how abundant the animals are) you may need to tow for different amounts of time. A good rule of thumb is to tow the net several lengths of the pier and then pull it up to check the density of animals. Be sure to rinse anything stuck on the sides of the net down into the cod end by raising and lowering it into the water several times. After pulling the net up, drain \~2/3 of the water from the cod end **before** unscrewing it from the net.

5.  Check the contents of the cod end to 1) ensure there are copepods present and 2) to check the approximate density (few, some, many, etc.). Keep in mind the number needed for the experiment - CTmax assays, for example, will only need 10-50 animals. Transfer the contents of the cod end to the insulated carrier. Record your initial observations about the abundance in the field notebook.

6.  Repeat the tow procedure as needed to obtain enough animals.

7.  Once finished, rinse the net (raising and lowering it out of the water several times without the cod end attached).

8.  Return to lab. It's important that you thoroughly rinse off the net in the sink before you return it to storage. Make sure the collection kit is ready for the next person to take it.
